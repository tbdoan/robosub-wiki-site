Hydrophones
-----------

Noise Floor - background subtraction
Closed form solution for the hydrophones
2D plane that’s tilted towards the hydrophones
Solve for an ellipsis in the actual plane
2Mhz seems very high for our frequency range
Kalman filter to check for static sound sources - ICA
If you recalculate and found that there are moving sound sources, then just remove them because
we know that the pinger is stationary, not movable
